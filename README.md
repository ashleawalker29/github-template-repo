# GitHub Template Repository

This repository is meant to more easily set up the organization and tracking aspect of GitHub. There
is a template for when creating a pull request.

This will assist in cutting down the time needed to initialize a repository and standardize the way
pull requests are used within the repository. The intent here is to increase readability,
consistency, and documentation within the repo by way of labels and templates.

# Pull Request Template

The Pull Request Template is, as the name suggests, used when creating a new pull request. This will
automatically be used for every pull request, you do not get to choose between different types.

To view more information based on the markdown, see the file
[pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md). You may notice that there are
sentences that are wrapped with `<!--` and `-->`. These do not need to be removed when finally
creating the new pull request, as they indicate that the sentences are commented out within the
markdown language used in creating the bodies of the pull request.
